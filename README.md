# Hangman-Game
Project to learn some python, play with graphics, and get a Hacktoberfest T-Shirt.
 All with the morbidity that is hanging someone for entertainment. 
 
 
 This game will begin by drawing the Hangman's noose
 
 Then it will select a random word to play with and draw a Letter Line for each letter in the word
 
 The player will be prompted to gess a letter, if it is included in the word then it will draw that in over
 the letter line, otherwise it will generate a body part on the hanged person
**Could be fun randomly alternating gender of hanged person, for equality**

If the person is fully generated then the game will display a Loss message and reveal the full word
If the word's final letter is filled in then you will receive a Win message and receive a point

Points are kept for the session

**Add an Insta-solve option**
**Add a hint option**
